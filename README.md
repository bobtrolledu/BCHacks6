## Inspiration
The inspiration for our project was to create a system that can simulate chromesthesia in the form of art and also generate perceptive descriptions

## What it does
The system we built allows user to visualize and generate audio visual art. This system will:
- Display audio in an unconventional way
- Help spread awareness of chromesthesia
- Provide insightful descriptions of art pieces

## How we built it
Using an engine in python, the script creates shape and form visualization of an audio file and displays what people with chromesthesia could possibly experience

## Challenges we ran into
As this is a hackathon project, the obvious challenge we ran into is time as we want to make a somewhat functional and presentable project in a 2 days span. The other is the fact that we never use the Django with react before.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some accomplishments that we're most proud of are:
- Django to frontend api
- Chromesthesia visualizations
- React frontend
- Seamless integration models
- Engaging animations

## What we learned
We learned how to use Django framework implemented together with a react front end
## What's next for Chromesthesia
Our big goal for chromesthesia is to spread awareness about differing neurological conditions that may affect people around us
